# Prerequisites

(copy and pasted from EMU manual)
A prerequisite that is presumed throughout this document is the reader's familiarity with basic terminology in the speech sciences (e.g., familiarity with the international phonetic alphabet and how speech is annotated at a coarse and fine grained level). Further, we assume the reader has a grasp of the basic concepts of the R language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. For readers new to R, there are multiple, freely available R tutorials online (e.g., [Statistical Analysis: an Introduction using R/R\_basics](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Statistical\_Analysis:\_an\_Introduction\_using\_R/R\_basics). R also has a set of very detailed manuals and tutorials that come preinstalled with R. To be able to access R's own "An Introduction to R" introduction, simply type `help.start()` into the R console and click on the link to the tutorial.

## Installing the EMU-SDMS

(copy and pasted from EMU manual)

1.) R

- Download the R programming language from  [http://www.cran.r-project.org](www.cran.r-project.org)
- Install the R programming language by executing the downloaded file and following the on-screen instructions.


2.) emuR

- Start up R.
- Enter `install.packages("emuR")` after the `>` prompt to install the package. (You will only need to repeat this if package updates become available.)
- As the `wrassp` package is a dependency of the `emuR` package, it does not have to be installed separately.

3.) EMU-webApp (prerequisite)

- The only thing needed to use the EMU-webApp is a current HTML5 compatible browser (Chrome/Firefox/Safari/Opera/...). However, as most of the development and testing is done using Chrome we recommend using it, as it is by far the best tested browser.

## Installing additional R-packages that are used throughout this course

- ggplot2 for visualization purposes: `install.packages("emuR")`
- dplyr for data manipulation: `install.packages("dplyr")`


```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
