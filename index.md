Welcome to the EMU-SDMS Manual! 

<span style="color:red"> Disclaimer: This manual is still in the making! It will eventually replace all the vignettes of emuR, wrassp as well as the EMU-webApp's own documentation. This manual is intended to consolidate all of this information in one easy to find location that can easily be updated as new features are added.</span>
