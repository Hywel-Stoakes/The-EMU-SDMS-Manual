# Installing the EMU-SDMS

1. `R`
  - Download the R programming language from  [http://www.cran.r-project.org](www.cran.r-project.org)
  - Install the R programming language by executing the downloaded file and following the on-screen instructions.

2. `emuR`
  - Start up `R`.
  - Enter `install.packages("emuR")` after the `>` prompt to install the package. (You will only need to repeat this if package updates become available.)
  - As the `wrassp` package is a dependency of the `emuR` package, it does not have to be installed separately.

3. `EMU-webApp` (prerequisite)
  - The only thing needed to use the `EMU-webApp` is a current HTML5 compatible browser (Chrome/Firefox/Safari/Opera/...). However, as most of the development and testing is done using Chrome we recommend using it, as it is by far the best tested browser.
