This chapter describes the `emuDB` format, which is the new database format of the EMU-SDMS, and shows how to create and interact with this format. The `emuDB` format is meant as a simple, general purpose way of storing speech databases that may contain complex, rich, hierarchical annotations as well as derived and complementary speech data. These different components will be described throughout this chapter, and examples will show how to generate and manipulate them. On designing the new EMU system, considerable effort went into designing an appropriate database format. We needed a format that was standardized, well structured, easy to maintain, easy to produce, easy to manipulate and portable.

We decided on the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) file format[^2-chap:emuDB] as our primary data source for several reasons. It is simple, standardized, widely-used and text-based as well as machine and human readable. In addition, this portable text format allows expert users to (semi-) automatically process and/or generate annotations. Other tools such as the BAS Webservices [@kisler:2012a] and SpeechRecorder [@draxler:2004a] have already taken advantage of being able to produce such annotations. Using database back-end options such as relational or graph databases of either the SQL or NoSQL variety as the primary data source for annotations would not directly permit other tools to produce annotations because intermediary exchange file formats would have to be defined to permit this functionality with these back-ends. Our choice of the JSON format was also guided by the decision to incorporate web technologies as part of the EMU-SDMS for which the JSON format is the de facto standard (see Chapter \@ref(chap:emu-webApp)). Further, as the default encoding of the JSON format is UTF-8 the EMU-SDMS fully supports the Unicode character set for any user-defined string within an `emuDB` (e.g. level names and labels)[^3-chap:emuDB].

[^2-chap:emuDB]: JSON schema files available here https://github.com/IPS-LMU/EMU-webApp/tree/master/dist/schemaFiles

[^3-chap:emuDB]: According to the JSON specification (see https://json.org/) the only characters that have to be escaped within a JSON string are: '' (as this marks the start/end of a string), \\  (as this is the escape character) or control-characters (\\b = backspace, \\f = form feed, \\n = new line, \\r = carriage return, \\t = tab). Unicode characters in their hexadecimal form using the \\u followed by for-hex-digits may also be used.

We chose to use the widely adopted Waveform Audio File Format (`WAVE`, or more commonly known as `WAV` due to its filename extension) as our primary media/audio format. Although some components of the EMU-SDMS, notably the `wrassp` package, can handle various other media/audio formats (see `?wrassp::AsspFileFormats` for details) this is the only audio file format currently supported by every component of the EMU-SDMS. Nevertheless, the `wrassp` package can be utilized to convert files from one of it's other supported file formats to the `WAV` format [^4-chap:emuDB]. Future releases of the EMU-SDMS might include the support of other media/audio formats.

[^4-chap:emuDB]: However, if things like resampeling are required we suggest using other tools such as the freely available Sound eXchange (SoX) command line tool (see http://sox.sourceforge.net/) to perform these operation

In contrast to other systems, including the legacy EMU system, we chose to fully standardize the on-disk structure of speech databases with which the system is capable of working. This provides a standardized and structured way of storing speech databases while providing the necessary amount of freedom and separability to accommodate multiple types of data. Further, this standardization enables fast parsing and simplification of file-based error tracking and simplifies database subset and merging operations as well as database portability. An overview of all database interaction functions is given in Section \@ref(sec:emuRpackageDetails-emuDBinteract).

## Database design

An `emuDB` consists of a set of files and directories that adhere to a certain structure and naming convention (see Figure \@ref(fig:schematic-emuDB-structure)). The database root directory must include a single `_DBconfig.json` file that contains the configuration options of the database such as its level definitions, how these levels are linked in the database hierarchy and how the data is to be displayed by the graphical user interface. A detailed description of the `_DBconfig.json` file is given in Appendix \@ref(subsec:app-chapFileFormatsDBconfig). The database root directory also contains arbitrarily named session directories (except for the obligatory `_ses` suffix). These session directories can be used to group the recordings of a database in a logical manner. Sessions can be used, for example, to group all recordings from speaker `AAA` into a session called `AAA_ses`.


```{r schematic-emuDB-structure, fig.cap="Schematic `emuDB` file and directory structure.", fig.align="center", echo=FALSE, out.width = "65%"}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/db_structure.png")
```

Each session directory can contain any number of `_bndl` directories (e.g., `rec1_bndl` `rec2_bndl` ... `rec9_bndl`). All files belonging to a recording (i.e., all files describing the same timeline) are stored in the same bundle directory. This includes the actual recording (`.wav`) and can contain optional derived or supplementary signal files in the simple signal file format (SSFF) [@cassidy:2013a] such as formants (`.fms`) or the fundamental frequency (`.f0`), both of which can be calculated using the `wrassp` package (see Chapter \@ref(chap:wrassp)). Each bundle directory contains the annotation file (`_annot.json`) of that bundle (i.e., the annotations and the hierarchical linking information; see Appendix \@ref(subsec:app-chapFileFormatsAnnotJSON) for a detailed description of the file format). JSON schema files for all the JSON files types used have been developed to ensure the syntactic integrity of the database (see https://github.com/IPS-LMU/EMU-webApp/tree/master/dist/schemaFiles). All files within a bundle that are associated with that bundle must have the same basename as the `_bndl` directory prefix. For example, the signal file in bundle `rec1_bndl` must have the name `rec1.wav` to be recognized as belonging to the bundle. The optional `_emuDBcache.sqlite` file in the root directory (see Figure \@ref(fig:schematic-emuDB-structure) contains the relational cache representation of the annotations of the `emuDB` (see Chapter \@ref(chap:querysys-impl) for further details). All files in an `_bndl` directory that do not follow the above naming conventions will simply be ignored by the database interaction functions of the `emuR` package.

## Creating an `emuDB`

The two main strategies for creating `emuDB`s are either to convert existing databases or file collections to the new format or to create new databases from scratch where only `.wav` audio files are present. Chapter \@ref(chap:tutorial) gave an example of how to create an `emuDB` from an existing TextGrid file collection and other conversion routines are covered in Section \@ref(sec:emuRpackageDetails-importRoutines). In this chapter we will focus on creating an `emuDB` from scratch with nothing more than a set of `.wav` audio files present.

### Creating an `emuDB` from scratch

The R code snippet below shows how an empty `emuDB` is created in the directory provided by R's `tempdir()` function. As can be seen by the output of the `list.files()` function, `create_emuDB()` creates a directory containing a `_DBconfig.json` file only.

```{r}
# load package
library(emuR, warn.conflicts = F)

# create demo data in directory 
# provided by tempdir()
create_emuRdemoData(dir = tempdir())

# create emuDB called "fromScratch"
create_emuDB(name = "fromScratch",
             targetDir = tempdir(),
             verbose = F)

# generate path to the empty fromScratch created above
dbPath = file.path(tempdir(), "fromScratch_emuDB")

# show content of empty fromScratch emuDB
list.files(dbPath)
```

### Loading and editing an empty database

The initial step in manipulating and generally interacting with a database is to load the database into the current R session. The R code below shows how to load the *fromScratch* database and shows the empty configuration by displaying the output of the `summary()` function.

```{r}
# load database
dbHandle = load_emuDB(dbPath, verbose = F)

# show summary of dbHandle
summary(dbHandle)

# show class vector of dbHandle
class(dbHandle)
```

As can be seen in the above R code example, the class of a loaded `emuDB` is `emuDBhandle`. A `emuDBhandle` object is used to reference a loaded `emuDB` in the database interaction functions of the `emuR` package. In this chapter we will show how to use this `emuDBhandle` object to perform database manipulation operations. Most of the `emuDB` manipulation functions follow the following function prefix naming convention:

- `add_XXX` add a new instance of `XXX` / `set_XXX` set the current instance of `XXX`,
- `list_XXX` list the current instances of `XXX` / `get_XXX` get the current instance of `XXX`,
- `remove_XXX` remove existing instances of `XXX`.

### Level definitions

Unlike other systems, the EMU-SDMS requires the user to formally define the annotation structure for the entire database. An essential structural element of any `emuDB` are its levels. A level is a more general term for what is often referred to as a tier. It is more general in the sense that people usually expect tiers to contain time information. Levels can either contain time information if they are of the type `EVENT` or of the type `SEGMENT` but are timeless if they are of the type `ITEM` (see Chapter \@ref(chap:annot-struct-mod) for further details). It is also worth noting that an `emuDB` distinguishes between the definition of an annotation structure element and the actual annotations. The definition of an annotation structure element such as a level definition is merely an entry in the `_DBconfig.json` file which specifies that this level is allowed to be present in the `_annot.json` files. The levels that are present in an `_annot.json` file, on the other hand, have to adhere to the definitions in the `_DBconfig.json`.

As the *fromScratch* database (already loaded) does not contain any annotation structural element definitions, the R code snippet below shows how a new level definition called *Phonetic* of type `SEGMENT` is added to the `emuDB`.

```{r}
# show no level definitions
# are present
list_levelDefinitions(dbHandle)

# add level defintion
add_levelDefinition(dbHandle,
                    name = "Phonetic",
                    type = "SEGMENT")

# show newly added level definition
list_levelDefinitions(dbHandle)
```

The example below shows how a further level definition is added that will contain the orthographic word transcriptions for the words uttered in our recordings. This level will be of the type `ITEM`, meaning that elements contained within the level are sequentially ordered but do not contain any time information.

```{r}
# add level definition
add_levelDefinition(dbHandle,
                    name = "Word",
                    type = "ITEM")

# list newly added level definition
list_levelDefinitions(dbHandle)
```

The function `remove_levelDefinition()` can also be used to remove unwanted level definitions. However, as we wish to further use the levels *Phonetic* and *Word*, we will not make use of this function here.


#### Attribute definitions

Each level definition can contain multiple attributes, the most common, and currently only supported attribute being a label (of type `STRING`). Thus it is possible to have multiple parallel labels (i.e., attribute definitions) in a single level. This means that a single annotation item instance can contain multiple labels while sharing other properties such as the start and duration information. This can be useful when modeling certain types of data. An example of this would be the *Phonetic* level created above. It is often the case that databases contain both the phonetic transcript using IPA UTF-8 symbols as well as a transcript using Speech Assessment Methods Phonetic Alphabet (SAMPA) symbols. To avoid redundant time information, both of these annotations can be stored on the same `Phonetic` level using multiple attribute definitions (i.e., parallel labels). The next R code snippet shows the current attribute definitions of the `Phonetic` level.


```{r}
# list attribute definitions of 'Phonetic' level
list_attributeDefinitions(dbHandle,
                          levelName = "Phonetic")
```

Even though no attribute definition has been added to the `Phonetic` level, it already contains an attribute definition that has the same name as its level. This attribute definition represents the obligatory primary attribute of that level. As every level must contain an attribute definition that has the same name as its level, it is automatically added by the `add_levelDefinition()` function. To follow the above example, the next R code snippet adds a further attribute definition to the `Phonetic` level that contains the SAMPA versions of our annotations.

```{r}
# add
add_attributeDefinition(dbHandle,
                        levelName = "Phonetic",
                        name = "SAMPA")

# list attribute definitions of 'Phonetic' level
list_attributeDefinitions(dbHandle,
                          levelName = "Phonetic")
```

<!-- % SIC should be subsubsubsection -->
#### Legal labels {#subsubsec:emuDBlegalLabels}

As can be inferred from the columns `hasLabelGroups` and `hasLegalLabels` of the output of the above `list_attributeDefinitions()` function, attribute definitions can also contain two further optional fields. The `legalLabels` field contains an array of strings that specifies the labels that are legal (i.e., allowed or valid) for the given attribute definition. As the `EMU-webApp` does not allow the annotator to enter any labels that are not specified in this array, this is a simple way of assuring that a level has a consistent label set. The following R code snippet shows how the `set_legalLabels` and `get_legalLabels` functions can be used to specify a legal label set for the primary `Word` attribute definition of the `Word` level.

```{r rexample:emuDB-setLegalLabels, rexample=TRUE}
# define allowed word labels
wordLabels = c("amongst", "any", "are",
               "always", "and", "attracts")

# show empty legal labels
# for "Word" attribute definition
get_legalLabels(dbHandle,
                levelName = "Word",
                attributeDefinitionName = "Word")

# set legal labels values
# for "Word" attribute definition
set_legalLabels(dbHandle,
                levelName = "Word",
                attributeDefinitionName = "Word",
                legalLabels = wordLabels)

# show recently added legal labels
# for "Word" attribute definition
get_legalLabels(dbHandle,
                levelName = "Word",
                attributeDefinitionName = "Word")
```


<!-- % should be subsubsub sesion -->
#### Label groups

A further optional field is the `labelGroups` field. It contains specifications of groups of labels that can be referenced by a name given to the group while querying the `emuDB`. The R code below shows how the `add_attrDefLabelGroup()` function is used to add two label groups to the `Phonetic` attribute definition. One of the groups is used to reference a subset of *longVowels* and the other to reference a subset of *shortVowels* on the `Phonetic` level.

```{r rexample:emuDB-addLabelGroup, rexample=TRUE}
# add long vowels label group
add_attrDefLabelGroup(dbHandle,
                      levelName = "Phonetic",
                      attributeDefinitionName = "Phonetic",
                      labelGroupName = "longVowels",
                      labelGroupValues = c("i:", "u:"))

# add short vowels label group
add_attrDefLabelGroup(dbHandle,
                      levelName = "Phonetic",
                      attributeDefinitionName = "Phonetic",
                      labelGroupName = "shortVowels",
                      labelGroupValues = c("i", "u", "@"))


# list current label groups
list_attrDefLabelGroups(dbHandle,
                        levelName = "Phonetic",
                        attributeDefinitionName = "Phonetic")

# query all short vowels
# Note the result of this query
# is empty as no annotations are present
# in the 'fromScratch' emuDB
query(dbHandle, "Phonetic == shortVowels")
```

For users who are familiar with or transitioning from the legacy EMU system, it is worth noting that the label groups correspond to the unfavorably named `Legal Labels` entries of the GTemplate Editor (i.e., legal entries in the `.tpl` file) of the legacy system. In the new system the `legalLabels` entries specify the legal or allowed label values of attribute definitions while the `labelGroups` specify groups of labels that can be referenced by the names given to the groups while performing queries.

A new feature of the EMU-SDMS is the possibility of defining label groups for the entire `emuDB` as opposed to a single attribute definition (see `?add_labelGroups` for further details). This avoids the redundant definition of label groups that should span multiple attribute definitions (e.g., a *longVowels* subset that is to be queried on a level called *Phonetic_1* as well as a level called *Phonetic_2*).


### Link definitions

An essential and very powerful conceptual and structural element of any `emuDB` is its hierarchy. Using hierarchical structures is highly recommended but not a must. Hierarchical annotations allow for complex, rich data modeling and are often cleaner representations of the annotations at hand. As Chapter \@ref(chap:annot-struct-mod) contains in-depth explanations of the annotation modeling capabilities of the EMU-SDMS and Chapter \@ref(chap:querysys) shows how these structures can be queried using `emuR`'s query mechanics, this chapter will omit an explanation of hierarchical annotation structures. The following R code shows how a `ONE_TO_MANY` relationship between the `Word` and `Phonetic` in the form of a link definition is added to an `emuDB`.

```{r}
# show that currently no link definitions
# are present
list_linkDefinitions(dbHandle)

# add new "ONE_TO_MANY" link definition
# between "Word" and "Phonetic" levels
add_linkDefinition(dbHandle,
                   type = "ONE_TO_MANY",
                   superlevelName = "Word",
                   sublevelName = "Phonetic")

# show newly added link definition
list_linkDefinitions(dbHandle)
```

A schematic of the simple hierarchical structure of the *fromScratch* created by the above R code is displayed in Figure \@ref(fig:emuDB-fromScratchHier).


```{r emuDB-fromScratchHier, fig.cap="A schematic representation of the simple hierarchical structure of the *fromScratch* created by the `add_linkDefinition()` function call in above R code snippet.", fig.align="center", echo=FALSE, out.width = "50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/fromScratchDBgraph.png")
```

### File handling

The previous sections of this chapter defined the simple structure of the *fromScratch* `emuDB`. An essential element that is still missing from the `emuDB` is the actual audio speech data[^5-chap:emuDB]. The following R code example shows how the `import_mediaFiles()` function can be used to import audio files, referred to as media files in the context of an `emuDB`, into the *fromScratch* `emuDB`.

[^5-chap:emuDB]: As the `EMU-webApp` currently only supports mono 16 Bit `.wav` audio files, we currently recommend using this format only.

```{r}
# get the path to directory containing .wav files
wavDir = file.path(tempdir(), "emuR_demoData", "txt_collection")

# Import media files into emuDB session called fromWavFiles.
# Note that the txt_collection directory also contains .txt files.
# These are simply ignored by the import_mediaFiles() function.
import_mediaFiles(dbHandle,
                  dir = wavDir,
                  targetSessionName = "fromWavFiles",
                  verbose = F)

# list session
list_sessions(dbHandle)

# list bundles
list_bundles(dbHandle)

# show first two files in the emuDB
library(tibble) # convert to tibble only to prettify output
as_tibble(head(list_files(dbHandle), n = 2))
```

The `import_mediaFiles()` call above added a new session called `fromWavFiles` to the *fromScratch* `emuDB` containing a new bundle for each of the imported media files. The annotations of every bundle, despite containing empty levels, adhere to the structure specified above. This means that every `_annot.json` file created contains an empty `Word` and `Phonetic` level array and the links array is also empty.

The `emuR` package also provides a mechanism for adding files to preexisting bundle directories, as this can be quite tedious to perform manually due to the nested directory structure of an `emuDB`. The following R code shows how preexisting `.zcr` files that are produced by `wrassp`'s `zcrana()` function can be added to the preexisting session and bundle structure. As the directory referenced by `wavDir` does not contain any `.zcr` files, the next R code example first creates them and then adds them to the `emuDB` (see Chapter \@ref(chap:wrassp) for further details).


```{r}
# load wrassp package
library(wrassp)

# list all wav files in wavDir
wavFilePaths = list.files(wavDir,
                          pattern = ".*.wav",
                          full.names = TRUE)

# calculate zero-crossing-rate files
# using zcrana function of wrassp package
zcrana(listOfFiles = wavFilePaths,
       verbose = FALSE)

# add zcr files to emuDB
add_files(dbHandle,
          dir = wavDir,
          fileExtension = "zcr",
          targetSessionName = "fromWavFiles")

# show first three files in emuDB (convert to tibble only
# to prettify output)
as_tibble(head(list_files(dbHandle), n = 3))
```


### SSFF track definitions

A further important structural element of any `emuDB` is use of the so-called SSFF tracks, which are often simply referred to as tracks. These SSFF tracks reference data that is stored in the SSFF (see Appendix \@ref(subsec:app-chapFileFormatsSSFF) for a detailed description of the file format) within the `_bndl` directories. The two main types of data are:

- complementary data that was acquired during the recording such as by EMA or EPG; or
- derived data, that is data that was calculated from the original audio signal such as formant values and their bandwidths or the short-term Root Mean Square amplitude of the signal.

As Section \@ref(sec:wrassp-emu-sdms) covers how the SSFF file output of a `wrassp` function can be added to an `emuDB`, an explanation will be omitted here. The following R code snippet shows how the `.zcr` files added in the R example above can be added as an SSFF track definition (see Chapter \@ref(chap:wrassp) for further details).

```{r}
# show that no SSFF track definitions
# are present
list_ssffTrackDefinitions(dbHandle)

# add SSFF track definition to emuDB
add_ssffTrackDefinition(dbHandle,
                        name = "zeroCrossing",
                        columnName = "zcr",
                        fileExtension = "zcr")

# show newly added SSFF track definition
list_ssffTrackDefinitions(dbHandle)
```

### Configuring the `EMU-webApp` and annotating the `emuDB`

As previously mentioned, the current *fromScratch* `emuDB` contains only empty levels. In order to start annotating the database, the `EMU-webApp` has to be configured to display the desired information. Although the configuration of the `EMU-webApp` is stored in the `_DBconfig.json` file and is therefore a part of the `emuDB` format, here we will omit an explanation of the extensive possibilities of configuring the web application (see Chapter \@ref(chap:emu-webApp) for an in-depth explanation). The R code snippet below shows how the `Phonetic` level is added to the level canvases order array of the *default* perspective.

```{r}
# show empty level canvases order
get_levelCanvasesOrder(dbHandle, perspectiveName = "default")

# set level canvases order to display "Phonetic" level
set_levelCanvasesOrder(dbHandle,
                       perspectiveName = "default",
                       order = c("Phonetic"))

# show newly added level canvases order
get_levelCanvasesOrder(dbHandle, perspectiveName = "default")
```

As a final step before beginning the annotation process, the *fromScratch* `emuDB` has to be served to the `EMU-webApp` for annotation and visualization purposes. The code below shows how this can be achieved using the `serve()` function.

```{r rexample:emuDB-serve, rexample=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# serve "fromScratch" emuDB to the EMU-webApp
serve(dbHandle)
```

## Conclusion

This chapter introduced the elements that comprise the new `emuDB` format and provided a practical overview of the essential database interaction functions provided by the `emuR` package. We feel the `emuDB` format provides a general purpose, flexible approach to storing speech databases with the added benefit of being able to directly manipulate and analyse these databases using the tools provided by the EMU-SDMS.
