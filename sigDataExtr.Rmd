As mentioned in the default workflow of Chapter \@ref(chap:overview}, after querying the symbolic annotation structure and dereferencing its time information, the result is a set of items with associated time stamps. It was necessary that the `emuR` package contain a mechanism for extracting signal data corresponding to this set of items. As illustrated in Chapter \@ref(chap:wrassp}, `wrassp` provides the R ecosystem with signal data file handling capabilities as well as numerous signal processing routines. `emuR` can use this functionality to either obtain pre-stored signal data or calculate derived signal data that correspond to the result of a query. Figure \@ref(fig:sigDataExtr}A shows a snippet of speech with overlaid annotations where the resulting `SEGMENT` of an example query (e.g., `"Phonetic == ai"`) is highlighted in yellow. Figure \@ref(fig:sigDataExtr)B displays a time parallel derived signal data contour as would be returned by one of `wrassp`'s file handling or signal processing routines. The yellow segment in Figure \@ref(fig:sigDataExtr)B marks the corresponding samples that belong to the `ai` segment of Figure \@ref(fig:sigDataExtr)A.

R Example \@ref(rexample:sigDataExtr-loadData) shows how to create the demo data that will be used throughout this chapter.

```{r rexample:sigDataExtr-loadData, rexample=TRUE, results='hide', message=FALSE}
# load the package
library(emuR)

# create demo data in directory provided by the tempdir() function
create_emuRdemoData(dir = tempdir())

# get the path to a emuDB called "ae" that is part of the demo data
path2directory = file.path(tempdir(), "emuR_demoData", "ae_emuDB")

# load emuDB into current R session
ae = load_emuDB(path2directory)
```

## Extracting pre-defined tracks

To access data that are stored in files, the user has to define tracks for a database that point to sequences of samples in files that match a user-specified file extension. The user-defined name of such a track can then be used to reference the track in the signal data extraction process. Internally, `emuR` uses `wrassp` to read the appropriate files from disk, extract the sample sequences that match the result of a query and return values to the user for further inspection and evaluation. R Example \@ref(rexample:sigDataExtr-getFm) shows how a signal track that is already defined in the `ae` demo database can be extracted for all annotation items on the `Phonetic` level containing the label `ai`.

```{r rexample:sigDataExtr-getFm, rexample=TRUE}
# list currently available tracks
list_ssffTrackDefinitions(ae)

# query all "ai" phonetic segments
ai_segs = query(ae, "Phonetic == ai")

# get "fm" track data for these segments
# Note that verbose is set to FALSE
# only to avoid a progress bar
# being printed in this document.
ai_td_fm = get_trackdata(ae,
                      seglist = ai_segs,
                      ssffTrackName = "fm",
                      verbose = FALSE)

# show summary of ai_td_fm
summary(ai_td_fm)
```

Being able to access data that is stored in files is important for two main reasons. Firstly, it is possible to generate files using external programs such as VoiceSauce [@shue:2011a], which can export its calculated output to the general purpose SSFF file format. This file mechanism is also used to access data produced by EMA, EPG or many other forms of signal data recordings. Secondly, it is possible to track, save and access manipulated data such as formant values that have been manually corrected. It is also worth noting that the `get_trackdata()` function has a predefined track which is always available without it having to be defined. The name of this track is `MEDIAFILE_SAMPLES` which references the actual samples of the audio files of the database. R Example \@ref(rexample:sigDataExtr-mediafileSamples) shows how this predefined track can be used to access the audio samples belonging to the segments in `ai_segs`.

```{r rexample:sigDataExtr-mediafileSamples, rexample=TRUE}
# get media file samples
ai_td_mfs = get_trackdata(ae,
                          seglist = ai_segs,
                          ssffTrackName = "MEDIAFILE_SAMPLES",
                          verbose = FALSE)

# show summary of ai_td_fm
summary(ai_td_mfs)
```

## Adding new tracks

As described in detail in Section \@ref(sec:wrassp-emu-sdms), the signal processing routines provided by the `wrassp` package can be used to produce SSFF files containing various derived signal data (e.g., formants, fundamental frequency, etc.). R Example \@ref(rexample:sigDataExtr-addTrack) shows how the `add_ssffTrackDefinition()` can be used to add a new track to the `ae` `emuDB`. Using the `onTheFlyFunctionName` parameter, the `add_ssffTrackDefinition()` function automatically executes the `wrassp` signal processing function `ksvF0` (`onTheFlyFunctionName = "ksvF0"`) and stores the results in SSFF files in the bundle directories.

```{r rexample:sigDataExtr-addTrack, rexample=TRUE}
# add new track and calculate
# .f0 files on-the-fly using wrassp::ksvF0()
add_ssffTrackDefinition(ae,
                        name = "F0",
                        onTheFlyFunctionName = "ksvF0",
                        verbose = FALSE)

# show newly added track
list_ssffTrackDefinitions(ae)

# show newly added files
library(tibble) # convert to tibble only to prettify output
as_tibble(list_files(ae, fileExtension = "f0"))

# extract newly added trackdata
ai_td = get_trackdata(ae,
                      seglist = ai_segs,
                      ssffTrackName = "F0",
                      verbose = FALSE)

# show summary of ai_td
summary(ai_td)
```


## Calculating tracks on-the-fly

With the `wrassp` package, we were able to implement a new form of signal data extraction which was not available in the legacy system. The user is now able to select one of the signal processing routines provided by `wrassp` and pass it on to the signal data extraction function. The signal data extraction function can then apply this `wrassp` function to each audio file as part of the signal data extraction process. This means that the user can quickly manipulate function parameters and evaluate the result without having to store to disk the files that would usually be generated by the various parameter experiments. In many cases this new functionality eliminates the need for defining a track definition for the entire database for temporary data analysis purposes. R Example \@ref(rexample:sigDataExtr-onTheFly) shows how the `onTheFlyFunctionName` parameter of the `get_trackdata()` function is used.


```{r rexample:sigDataExtr-onTheFly, rexample=TRUE}
ai_td_pit = get_trackdata(ae,
                          seglist = ai_segs,
                          onTheFlyFunctionName = "mhsF0",
                          verbose = FALSE)

# show summary of ai_td
summary(ai_td_pit)
```

## The resulting object: `trackdata` vs. `emuRtrackdata`

The default resulting object of a call to `get_trackdata()` is of class `trackdata` (see R Example \@ref(rexample:sigDataExtr-trackdata)). The `emuR` package provides multiple routines such as `dcut()`, `trapply()` and `dplot()` for processing and visually inspecting objects of this type (see harrington:2010a and Section \@ref(section:tutorial-sigExtrAndExpl) for examples of how these can be used).


```{r rexample:sigDataExtr-trackdata, rexample=TRUE}
# show class vector of ai_td_pit
class(ai_td_pit)
```

As the `trackdata` object is a fairly complex nested matrix object with internal reference matrices, which can be cumbersome to work with, the `emuR` package introduces a new equivalent object type called `emuRtrackdata` that essentially is a flat `data.frame` object. This object type can be retrieved by setting the `resultType` parameter of the `get_trackdata()` function to `emuRtrackdata`. R Example \@ref(rexample:sigDataExtr-emuRtrackdata) shows how this can be achieved.

```{r rexample:sigDataExtr-emuRtrackdata, rexample=TRUE}
ai_emuRtd_pit = get_trackdata(ae,
                              seglist = ai_segs,
                              onTheFlyFunctionName = "mhsF0",
                              resultType = "emuRtrackdata",
                              verbose = FALSE)

# show first row (convert to tibble only to prettify output)
as_tibble(ai_emuRtd_pit[1, ])

# show relative time values of the first segment
# (relative time values always start at 0 for every segment)
ai_emuRtd_pit[ai_emuRtd_pit$sl_rowIdx == 1, ]$times_rel

# show original time values of the first segment
# (absolute time values always start at the original
# time stamp for that sample within the track)
ai_emuRtd_pit[ai_emuRtd_pit$sl_rowIdx == 1, ]$times_orig
```

As can be seen by the first row output of R Example \@ref(rexample:sigDataExtr-emuRtrackdata), the `emuRtrackdata` object is an amalgamation of both a segment list and a `trackdata` object. The first `sl_rowIdx` column of the `ai_emuRtd_pit` object indicates the row index of the segment list the current row belongs to, the `times_rel` and `times_orig` columns represent the relative time and the original time of the samples contained in the current row (see R Example \@ref(rexample:sigDataExtr-emuRtrackdata)) and T1 (to Tn in n dimensional `trackdata`) contains the actual signal sample values. It is also worth noting that the `emuR` package provides a function called `create_emuRtrackdata()`, which allows users to create `emuRtrackdata` from a segment list and a `trackdata` object. This is beneficial as it allows `trackdata` objects to be processed using functions provided by the `emuR` package (e.g., `dcut()` and `trapply()`) and then converts them into a standardized `data.frame` object for further processing (e.g., using R packages such as `lme4` or `ggplot2` which were implemented to use with `data.frame` objects). R Example \@ref(rexample:sigDataExtr-createEmuRtd) shows how the `create_emuRtrackdata()` function is used.

```{r rexample:sigDataExtr-createEmuRtd, rexample=TRUE}
# create emuRtrackdata object
ai_emuRtd_pit  = create_emuRtrackdata(sl = ai_segs,
                                      td = ai_td_pit)

# show first row and
# selected columns of ai_emuRtd_pit
ai_emuRtd_pit[1, ]

```


The general question remains as to when to use the `trackdata` and when to use the `emuRtrackdata` object and what the benefit of each class is. The `trackdata` object has a number of associated class functions (e.g. `trapply()`, `dcut()`, `dcut()` and `eplot()`) that ease data manipulation and visualization. Further, it avoids data redundancy and therefore has a smaller memory footprint than the `emuRtrackdata` object (this is usually negligible on current systems); however, this makes it rather difficult to work with. The `emuRtrackdata` object is intended as a long term replacement for the `trackdata` object as it contains all of the information of the corresponding `trackdata` object as well as its associated segment list. As is often the case with tabular data, the `emuRtrackdata` object carries certain redundant information (e.g. segment start and end times). However, the benefit of having a `data.frame` object that contains all the information needed to process the data is the ability to replace package specific functions (e.g. trapply() etc.) with standardized `data.frame` processing and visualization procedures that can be applied to any `data.frame` object independent of the package that generated it. Therefore, the knowledge that is necessary to process an `emuRtrackdata` object can be transferred to/from other packages which is not the case for `trackdata` object. Future releases of the `emuR` package as well as this manual will contain various examples of how to replace the functionality of the package-specific functions mentioned above with equivalent data manipulation and visualization using the `dplyr` as well as the `ggplot2` packages.


## Conclusion

This chapter introduced the signal data extraction mechanics of the `emuR` package. The combination of the `get_trackdata()` function and the file handling and signal processing abilities of the `wrassp` package (see Chapter \@ref(chap:wrassp) for further details) provide the user with a flexible system for extracting derived or complementary signal data belonging to their queried annotation items.
