R Download the R programming language from http://www.cran.r-project.org Install the R programming language by executing the downloaded file and following the on-screen instructions. 2.) emuR Start up R. Enter install.packages(&quot;emuR&quot;) after the &gt; prompt to install the package. (You will only need to repeat this if package updates become available.) As the wrassp package is a dependency of the emuR package, it does not have to be installed separately. 3.) EMU-webApp (prerequisite) The only thing needed to use the EMU-webApp is a current HTML5 compatible browser (Chrome/Firefox/Safari/Opera/â€¦). However, as most of the development and testing is done using Chrome we recommend using it, as it is by far the best tested browser. 1.2 Installing additional R-packages that are used throughout this document ggplot2 for visualization purposes: install.packages(&quot;emuR&quot;) dplyr for data manipulation: install.packages(&quot;dplyr&quot;) 1.3 Version disclaimer This document describes the following versions of the software components: wrassp Package version: 0.1.4 Git SHA1: 96d357f18e8a7fcf9ff60bd4969563605cecf7a7 emuR Package version: packageVersion(&quot;emuR&quot;) Git SHA1: 1637435962c5da261c67d11d3ddb3e2d0773833c EMU-webApp Version: 0.1.10 Git SHA1: a1102dc4b42b9298e6bddc2299fb62a996961dd4 As the development of the EMU Speech Database Management System is still ongoing, be sure you have the correct documentation to go with the version you are using. 1.3.1 For developers and people interested in the source code The information on how to install and/or access the source code of the developer version including the possibility of accessing the versions described in this document (via the Git SHA1 hashes mentioned above) is given below. wrassp Source code is available here: https://github.com/IPS-LMU/wrassp/ Install developer version in R: install.packages(&quot;devtools&quot;); library(&quot;devtools&quot;); install_github(&quot;IPS-LMU/wrassp&quot;) Bug reports: https://github.com/IPS-LMU/wrassp/issues emuR Source code is available here: https://github.com/IPS-LMU/emuR/ Install developer version in R: install.packages(&quot;devtools&quot;); library(&quot;devtools&quot;); install_github(&quot;IPS-LMU/emuR&quot;) Bug reports: https://github.com/IPS-LMU/emuR/issues EMU-webApp Source code is available here: https://github.com/IPS-LMU/EMU-webApp/ Bug reports: https://github.com/IPS-LMU/EMU-webApp/issues "]
